                <h3>Here's a timeline on Stephen Hawking's career:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <p> Hawking was born on 8 January 1942 in Oxford, England </p>
                    <li><strong>1950</strong> - Hawking and his family moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire</li><br/>
                    <li><strong>1952</strong> - Hawking attended Radlett School, an independent school in the village <br/> of Radlett in Hertfordshire, for a year.</li><br/>
                    <li><strong>1959</strong> - Hawking was awarded a scholarship after taking the examinations.</li><br/>
                    <li><strong>1960</strong> -Hawking began his university education at University College, <br/> Oxford at the age of 17</li><br/>
                    <li><strong>1962</strong> - After receiving a first-class BA (Hons.) degree in natural science and <br/> completing a trip to Iran with a friend, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge.</li><br/>
                    <li><strong>1964</strong> - Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he<br/> publicly challenged the work of Fred Hoyle and his student Jayant Narlikar at a lecture.</li><br/>
                    <li><strong>1970</strong> - Hawking postulated what became known as the second law of black hole dynamics,<br/> that the event horizon of a black hole can never get smaller.</li><br/>
                    <li><strong>1973</strong> - Hawking moved into the study of quantum gravity and quantum mechanics.</li><br/>
                    <li><strong>1975</strong> -Hawking returned to Cambridge to a more academically senior post, <br/> as reader in gravitational physics.</li><br/>
                    <li><strong>1985</strong> -Further work by Hawking in the area of arrows of time publication of a paper<br/> theorising that if the no-boundary proposition were correct, then when the universe stopped<br/> expanding and eventually collapsed,
                        time would</li><br/> run backwards.</li><br/>
                    <li><strong>1993</strong> - he co-edited a book on Euclidean quantum gravity with Gary Gibbons and <br> published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and the Big Bang.</li><br/>
                    <li><strong>2001</strong> -Hawking continued his writings for a popular audience, publishing The<br/> Universe in a Nutshell.</li><br/>
                    <li><strong>2015</strong> - Hawking said that not all information is lost when something enters a black hole<br/> and there might be a possibility to retrieve information from a black hole according to his theory.</li><br/>
                    <li><strong>2017</strong> - Hawking was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Imperial College London.</li><br/>
                    <ul>
